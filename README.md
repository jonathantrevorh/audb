## TODO
- vptree impl - done
- emailing prof to verify that we use sqlite instead what was proposed - done
- investigation on virtual table integration with sqlite - done (it's possible and the path we've chosen)
- implementing virtual table to connect to vp tree impl - in progress

## Requirements
The `sqlite3-dev` package is required for sqlite3 header files.

## Running
Not final packaging, but running `./sqbuild` compiles the extension and run test commands in sqlite3.
